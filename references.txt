This website is for an Indian restaurant that operates like a Chipotle. I grew up eating 
healthy, delectable, mouth watering, spicy, full of flavor Indian food and 
I think if Indian food were offered in a build-your-own model (as opposed to sit-in restaurants),
many people would make this restaurant a common part of their lives. This website will communicate
that Indian food is much more similar to food in other cultures than previously thought and 
is much more than the standard perception of Indian food as naan and chicken tikka masala; 
it is fresh, healthy, warm, comforting, and incredibly diverse. The website should also communicate
the connvenience of getting this high-quality meal with the build-your-own model. The website should 
have sections for the menu, ordering, health, about us, and contact page.

Choolah is an Indian Chipotle that already exists and so my 
goal is to build a website inspired by theirs but simpler. However, although 
I think the Choolah website is beatifully designed with smooth animations, high quality 
pictures, and simplistic layout/grouping, I feel the website is a little cluttered. I am seeking
to balance elements from the super-simplistic Chipotle website with those from the
Choolah website. I will priortize the build-your-own menu section.

Color Scheme Used:
The main colors I used were rgb(197, 15, 15) (a form of bright red) and white. Red is a 
common color used by restaurants since red invokes hunger, appetite, and attention. This is
why I made the majority of open space red. The simple red and white color scheme causes contrast
that draws readers' attention to the white text (menu items, health standards, etc.). The color
scheme is very simple as to comfort and not overwhelm the user and let the red have as much effect
as possible.
